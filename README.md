## Introduction

Write a little bit about what the project is - why you made it, what it does.

## Installation

How do we get the program to run in the first place; things like `pip install -r requirements.txt` (located in src/).

## Usage

How do we use the program? Does it take command line input, does it need files put in specific places?

## Acknowledgments

This is where all references and the like go.
