## Results

This is where the results of the model go. The folder `Model L0` gets the raw results copied from the model's own output folders, and stores them here for safekeeping and further analysis. The folder `Model Figures` gets all the output figures generated by the various plotting functions (see the documentation in `src/`), each in their own folder named after the simulation runs. Lastly, `Measurment Figures` is reserved for the plotting functions related to the measurement data, and some other miscellaneous plots.
